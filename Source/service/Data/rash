When you break out in a rash, it's natural to wonder: Did I touch something I'm allergic to?
An allergist or dermatologist can help you figure it out. You probably don't need a doctor if you know your rash is linked to a specific trigger you can avoid, or if you have a mild reaction that clears up on its own.
But make an appointment if you have any doubts.
Testing for Skin Allergies
If you brush up against something and you get a rash, your doctor may tell you that you've got "contact dermatitis." It happens when your skin touches something you're sensitive or allergic to.
He’ll examine you and ask whether you recently came in contact with common allergy triggers like perfume, jewelry, or latex.
If he thinks an allergy may be the cause, you might get a "patch" test. He'll put patches on you that have tiny amounts of things that could cause an allergic reaction.
They have to stay dry, so you can't shower or bathe during the test period. You need to avoid sweating, too. After 48 hours, your doctor will look at your skin to see if you have a reaction to anything. He may schedule another follow-up a few days later to check again.
In rare cases, he may want to do a blood test or a biopsy. For a biopsy, he’ll take a small sample of your skin for testing.
It's important to avoid your allergy trigger if you get hives (red, itchy welts on the surface of your skin) or swelling beneath your skin.
In case your doctor can't figure out the cause, he may recommend over-the-counter or prescription antihistamine pills.
If your skin gets infected because it's open and raw, you may need an antibiotic to clear it up. Symptoms of an infection include:
Swelling or redness
Heat
Pus
Tender, crusty skin
Shingles
Ringworm
Skin Rash
Bug Bites
Skin Cancer
Eczema
Hives
Cold Sores
Boils
Burns
Warts
Acne
