The biggest spring allergy trigger is pollen. Trees, grasses, and weeds release these tiny grains into the air to fertilize other plants. When they get into the nose of someone who’s allergic, they send the body's defenses haywire.
The immune system mistakenly sees the pollen as a danger and releases antibodies that attack the allergens. That leads to the release of chemicals called histamines into the blood. Histamines trigger the runny nose, itchy eyes, and other symptoms that are all too familiar if you have allergies.
Pollen can travel for miles, so it’s not just about the plants in your neighborhood.
If you have a pollen allergy and go outside on a day when it’s flying around, your body will react as if it’s being invaded. Your immune system will make a lot of something called histamine to fight back. When this happens, you can have symptoms like:
Itchy throat
Red, itchy, watery eyes
Runny or stuffy nose
Sneezi
Wheezing or coughing'
A food allergy happens when your immune system reacts to something that you’ve eaten.
When you eat something you are allergic to, your body makes antibodies. Over time, sometimes as soon as the second time you eat it, the antibodies spring into action, starting a process that includes the release of lots of histamine to fight what it believes is invading your body.
Histamine is a powerful chemical that can affect your respiratory system, digestive tract, skin, and heart and blood vessels.
Symptoms may appear almost immediately or up to 2 hours after you've eaten the food. Symptoms can include:
A tingling sensation of the mouth
Swelling of the tongue and throat
Hives
Skin rashes
Vomiting
Abdominal cramps
Trouble breathing
Diarrhea
A drop in blood pressure
Loss of consciousness
Severe reactions, called anaphylaxis, can result in death.
You can get a rash in areas that come in contact with foods. Some people are so sensitive to food allergens that the odor of that particular food can cause a reaction.
