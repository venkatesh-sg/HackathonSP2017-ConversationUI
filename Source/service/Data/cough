The common cold, including chest cold and head cold, and seasonal flu are caused by viruses. Use over-the-counter cold medications to relieve symptoms including sore throat, runny nose, congestion, and cough. Flu symptoms are similar, but include fever, headache and muscle soreness. See a doctor who may prescribe antiviral medications Relenza or Tamiflu.
Your nose is running, you've got a cough, and your throat is raw. Is it a cold, allergies, or the flu?
There are similarities to all three, but a few telltale signs can help you tell them apart.
The Start of a Cold
It usually begins with a sore throat, and before you know it, you've also got these symptoms:
Runny nose (clear and watery)
Sneezing
Fatigue
Cough
You usually don't get a fever with a cold. If you do, it may be a sign you've got the flu or an infection with a bacteria.
For the first few days that you're sick, your runny nose will be watery, but it turns thicker and darker after that. You may also get a mild cough that can last into the second week of your cold.
Since a cold can make your asthma worse, check with your doctor to see if you need to change your regular treatment plan.
If you cough up thick or dark mucus or you get a fever, you may have an infection with a bacteria. See your doctor to find out how to treat it. Also see him if your cough doesn't get better after a few weeks.
Your symptoms usually start between 1 and 3 days after you get infected with a cold virus. They typically last for about 3 to 7 days. By then the worst is over, but you may feel stuffed up for a week or more.
You're most contagious during the first 3 days that you're sick, but it's still possible to spread it during the first week.
