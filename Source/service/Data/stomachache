A stomach ache, including stomach cramps or abdominal pain, doesn't usually last long and isn't usually caused by anything serious. 
Some common causes of a stomach ache include:
trapped wind (flatulence)
pain or discomfort after eating (indigestion)
being unable to poo (constipation)
Speak to your pharmacist for advice about medications to help ease symptoms of these conditions.
If you have diarrhoea and vomiting, it will usually clear up by itself within a week.
Read about what to do if you have diarrhoea and vomiting.
When to get medical advice
See your GP or call NHS 111 if you're worried or need advice about your symptoms.
For example, if:
the pain gets much worse in a short space of time
the pain won't go away or keeps returning
you have unexpected weight loss
you have unusual vaginal discharge
you bleed from your bottom
you have a persistent change in toilet habits
Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest hospital accident and emergency (A&E) if you:
have sudden, severe stomach pain
feel pain when you touch your stomach
are vomiting blood 
have bloody or black, sticky stools
aren't able to urinate

you're diabetic and vomiting
If you feel pain in the area around your ribs, read about chest pain for information and advice.
