Cardiologists work in hospitals and in private practices. If you see a cardiologist, he or she may:
Give you a physical exam
Order special tests, such as an ECG, blood test, or exercise test, exercise stress test, or echocardiogram
Interpret the results of tests to diagnose a health condition you may have
Prescribe treatment, such as medicine
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
Congenital Heart Defects
Cardiomyopathy
Peripheral Artery Disease
Counsel you on risks and prevention
Do some procedures, such as cardiac catheterization or implant a pacemaker
Refer you to a cardiac surgeon or an interventional cardiologist if you need an invasive procedure
Cardiologists see a range of patients and conditions — from young adults with complex congenital disease or cardiomyopathies to a middle-aged population with coronary artery disease or coronary artery disease risks to an aging population with heart failure. What’s more, caring for these conditions involves a balance between procedures (e.g., echocardiograms, cardiac catheterizations, electrophysiology procedures).
